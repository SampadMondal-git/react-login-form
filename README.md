Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

**npm start**
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

**npm test**
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

**npm run build**
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

**npm run eject**

 Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!
 This removes the tool and copies build scripts into your package.json.
